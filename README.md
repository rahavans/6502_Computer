# 6502 Breadboard Computer

Hi! This is a side project I am working on, where I will be building a breadboard computer, using a 6502 microprocessor. I will be making this project with the guidance of Ben Eater (https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater/featured), who developed the idea of this project, and from whom I also purchased the equipment from.

The purpose of this project is to really understand the basic architecture of a computer and how it operates, and how instructions are executed. I will also be developing a few programs in 6502 Assembly.

Stay tuned for the progress!
